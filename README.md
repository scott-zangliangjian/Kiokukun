a tool to help you remember new words when studying foreign languages

## Motivation

As a Chinese working in Japan, I spent lots of time to study foriegn languages.
I feel, besides grammar, reading, listening, speaking, etc,
one fundamental and important thing for studying foreign languages is
just memorizing the new words.
So I need a tool to help me memorize new words,
which I can use on my laptop and mobile phone easily.

## Design

This is quite a simple idea,
So I don't want to use any framework,
I just write using raw PHP and SQL code.

## Installation

## TODO

* Bug fix
* Support more users
